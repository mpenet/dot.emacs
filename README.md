This bugs me with emacs, I have to do some actual
coding to get it usable and maintainable.

This is far from perfect and should be using submodules,
but will get you started.

I chose against package.el & marmalade.

The rationale is this

* You feed a list of paths and modules to require
* You populate a directory for customizations

Have fun
